## üìù About the Project

This project is a full-featured, multi-vendor e-commerce RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework. It provides a robust backend system that allows registered users to become sellers, manage their products (which require admin approval), while buyers can browse products, manage a shopping cart, place orders, and provide reviews.

The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, following best practices for modern web API development.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into modular Django apps for better separation of concerns:

- `ecommerce_api/`: Main project configuration directory.
- `users/`: Handles user registration, authentication, and profiles (template-based).
- `products/`: Manages product details, listings, and seller associations.
- `categories/`: Manages product categories.
- `orders/`: Handles order creation, status tracking, and order items.
- `payments/`: Handles payment processing integrations.
- `reviews/`: Manages user reviews and ratings for products.
- `media/`: Stores user-uploaded files like product images.

## üìä Database Schema (ERD)

The database is designed to support the complex relationships in an e-commerce platform. The key entities include Users, Products, Categories, Orders, OrderItems, and Reviews.

_Note: The project also includes several template-based URLs for rendering HTML pages (e.g., `/register/`, `/login/`, `/products/`, `/categories/`, `/my-orders/`). The table above focuses exclusively on the RESTful API endpoints that handle JSON data._

curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/api/laptop-pro/ \
-H "Authorization: Token YOUR_SELLER_AUTH_TOKEN"

curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/categories/api/electronics/ \
-H "Authorization: Token YOUR_ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Fixes

- **Categories**: The API path is `/categories/api/`. To activate it, you must uncomment the line `path("api/", include(api_router.urls)),` in your `categories/urls.py` file.
- **Orders**: The Orders API endpoints have been removed from this table as they do not exist in your provided `orders/urls.py` file. That file only contains template-based views.
- **Reviews**: The Reviews API endpoints have been added as they exist in your project structure but were missing from the original table. The correct path is `/reviews/api/reviews/`.
