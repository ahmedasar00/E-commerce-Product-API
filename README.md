## üìù About the Project

This project is a full-featured, multi-vendor e-commerce RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework. It provides a robust backend system that allows registered users to become sellers, manage their products (which require admin approval), while buyers can browse products, manage a shopping cart, place orders, and provide reviews.

The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, following best practices for modern web API development.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into modular Django apps for better separation of concerns:

- `ecommerce_api/`: Main project configuration directory.
- `users/`: Handles user registration, authentication, and profiles (template-based).
- `products/`: Manages product details, listings, and seller associations.
- `categories/`: Manages product categories.
- `orders/`: Handles order creation, status tracking, and order items.
- `payments/`: Handles payment processing integrations.
- `reviews/`: Manages user reviews and ratings for products.
- `media/`: Stores user-uploaded files like product images.

## üìä Database Schema (ERD)
