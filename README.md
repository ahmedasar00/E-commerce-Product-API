## üìù About the Project

This project is a full-featured, multi-vendor e-commerce RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework. It provides a robust backend system that allows registered users to become sellers, manage their products (which require admin approval), while buyers can browse products, manage a shopping cart, place orders, and provide reviews.

The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, following best practices for modern web API development.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **User Management & Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Multi-Vendor System:** Users can register as sellers and manage their own product listings.
- **Product Management:** Complete CRUD operations for products, including image uploads.
- **Admin Approval System:** Products submitted by sellers must be approved by an admin before they become visible to buyers.
- **Category & Filtering:** Products are organized by categories, with advanced filtering options (by category, price range, availability).
- **Shopping Cart:** Persistent shopping cart for each authenticated user.
- **Order Management:** A complete system for placing and tracking orders.
- **Reviews & Ratings:** Users can leave reviews and ratings for products they have purchased.
- **Search Functionality:** Flexible product search by name or category.
- **Pagination:** Efficiently handles large datasets for product listings and search results.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into modular Django apps for better separation of concerns:

- `ecommerce_api/`: Main project configuration directory.
- `users/`: Handles user registration, authentication, and profiles.
- `products/`: Manages product details, listings, and seller associations.
- `categories/`: Manages product categories.
- `orders/`: Handles order creation, status tracking, and order items.
- `payments/`: (Future implementation) Will handle payment processing integrations.
- `reviews/`: Manages user reviews and ratings for products.
- `media/`: Stores user-uploaded files like product images.

## üìä Database Schema (ERD)

The database is designed to support the complex relationships in an e-commerce platform. The key entities include Users, Products, Categories, Orders, OrderItems, and Reviews.
